It aims to establish the social study of education at the centre stage of political and sociological debate about post-industrial societies. In examining major changes which have taken place in the late twentieth century, it gives students a comprehensive introduction to both the nature of these changes and to their interpretation in relation to long-standing debates within education, sociology, and cultural studies.   The extensive editorial introduction outlines the major theoretical approaches within the sociology of education, assesses their contribution to an adequate understanding of the changing educational context, and sets out the key issues and areas for future research. The 52 papers in this wide-ranging thematic reader bring together the most powerful work in education into an international dialogue which is sure to become a classic text.",

All chapters have been revised to take into account the rapid evolution of the ways in which we consume, generate, store and exchange information, such as cloud computing, off-shoring and Web 2.0.Now established as a standard text on computer and information technology law, this book analyses the unique legal problems which arise from computing technology and transactions carried out through the exchange of digital information rather than human interaction. Topics covered range from contractual matters and intellectual property protection to electronic commerce, data protection and liability of internet service providers. Competition law issues are integrated into the various commercial sections as they arise to indicate their interaction with information technology law.",
