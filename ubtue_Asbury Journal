				"abstractNote": "The church does not need more vital congregations, but rather a few vital Christians, whose vitality is not measured in terms of institutional effectiveness, but by missionary zeal. This zeal is a hungering and thirsting for just one thing: the glory of God and the salvation of souls. It cannot be manufactured, but can only be caught from those who have been gifted by the Spirit to continue the charism of their founder, and fanned into flame. Without this type of Christian, there is no movement, and there is no Methodism. John Welsey's most important legacy was not his doctrine or his discipline but a movement of zealous preachers and people who put flesh on the way of scriptural holiness. This paper explores the nature of that legacy and the spiritual zeal it fostered. This paper concludes that this same \"spirit\" is available to all who would commit to the doctrine and discipline of the Methodist movement. A version of this paper was delivered before the faculty of Asbury Theological Seminary to conclude the formal installation of the author in the Sundo Kim Chair of Evangelism on December 4, 2018.",

He relates these experiences to similar issues in Russia today, adding a Christian plea for equality and fair treatment for all people by the Christian community, and also calling on the Church to stand in opposition to racism and anti-Semitism wherever it appears.",

				"abstractNote": "Byang Henry Kato, a promising African Christian leader, passed away in 1975 at only 39 years of age. In spite of his brief career, he has left his imprint on the pages of African Christian history. He is not without his supporters and critics alike. It appears that while his critics have misunderstood him in some aspects, his supporters have not paid enough attention to his theological conviction and articulation. While this article aims at clarifying some of Kato's conviction, it also informs readers how, regardless of context and time, others can appreciate, learn, and even adopt some aspects of his contextual model. The writer, an Asian living more than forty years apart from Kato, argues that Kato was indeed an evangelical leader whose theological conviction and model cannot be confined merely to a past era.",
