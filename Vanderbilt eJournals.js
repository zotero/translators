				"abstractNote": "“Music City, U.S.A.” celebrates many cultures and music, but often Nashville is identified with singing cowboys with southern drawls. Some are quick to call this country-western image “inauthentic,” pointing out that middle Tennessee’s forested hills were never home to cattle ranches or Gene Autry. Indeed, the labels of “authentic” or “inauthentic” have become widely used in contemporary society to denote whether a thing is essentially true or untrue. In his evaluation of the 1960s music “myth” in which folk music was deemed authentic and pop music inauthentic, sociologist Simon Frith argues that the central issue was less about the music itself and more about the communication of a person’s identity through that music. An examination of the concept of authenticity as it has evolved through history and presented itself in recent scholarship and a survey of Nashville residents and college students reveal that the quest for authenticity in tourism and consumerism is closely linked to the construction of identity. While the concept of authenticity is demonstrably problematic, it retains its power because it provides a framework against which individuals can define themselves in an increasingly global world. The quest for authenticity in music, then, becomes a quest for truth about oneself for which there is no objective answer. Authenticity is fundamentally a question of perspective. Who can say whether Nashville is authentic or not? All that can be said is simply that Nashville is.",

				"abstractNote": "Much has been written concerning the New England Puritan Jonathan Edwards, addressing his multifaceted activities as a theologian, preacher, revivalist, pastor, polemicist and missionary. In particular this study focuses upon the rhetorical influences that shaped his preaching ministry: his personal faith experiences, the preaching of his father and grandfather, the Puritan preaching tradition, and the rhetoric of Peter Ramus. While he preached within the sometimes narrow constraints of his New England Puritan tradition, Edwards nonetheless found some freedom to experiment with the classic inherited Puritan tripartite sermon form. Although he never truly departed from this sermon format, his attempts at innovation within his tradition serves as a model for preachers today. Such a legacy may well inspire preachers operating within the confines of hermeneutical or denominational tradition, but who seek to reconfigure elements of their inherited preaching influences.",

				"abstractNote": "Historically, Canadian literature has been chary of entering too far into the new discipline of inter-American literary study.  Rightly concerned about the danger of blurring its identity as a distinctive national literature (one made up, as is well known, of two great strands, the French and the English), Canadian writing has, however, come of age, both nationally and internationally.  One dramatic aspect of this transformation is that we now have mounting evidence that both English and French Canadian writers are actively engaging with the literatures and cultures of their hemispheric neighbors.  By extending the methodologies of Comparative Literature to the inter-American paradigm, Canadian writers, critics, and literary historians are finding ways to maintain their status as members of a unique and under-appreciated national literature while also entering into the kinds of comparative studies that demonstrate their New World ties as well.",
