				"abstractNote": "Exploring the role of microRNAs in the antipsychotic efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) will contribute to understanding the underlying mechanism through which ECT exerts its therapeutic effects. The primary objective of this study was to identify microRNA alterations before and after ECT in patients with schizophrenia. We compared microarray-based microRNA profiles in peripheral blood from eight patients with schizophrenia before and after ECT and eight healthy controls. Then, we aimed to validate selected differentially expressed microRNAs in 30 patients with schizophrenia following a course of ECT, alongside 30 healthy controls by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Microarray-based expression profiling revealed alterations in 681 microRNAs when comparing pre- and post-ECT samples. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis of the selected microRNAs (miR-20a-5p and miR-598) did not reveal any statistical differences between pre- and post-ECT samples nor between pre-ECT samples and those of healthy controls. As neuroepigenetic studies on ECT are still in their infancy, the results reported in this study are best interpreted as exploratory outcomes. Additional studies are required to explore the potential epigenetic mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of ECT.",

				"abstractNote": "Objectives\n\nObtaining urine samples in younger children undergoing urinary tract infection (UTI) screening can be challenging in busy emergency departments (EDs), and sterile techniques, like catheterization, are invasive, traumatizing, and time consuming to complete. Noninvasive techniques have been shown to reduce catheterization rates but are variably implemented. Our aim was to implement a standardized urine bag UTI screening approach in febrile children aged 6 to 24 months to decrease the number of unnecessary catheterizations by 50% without impacting ED length of stay (LOS) or return visits (RVs).\n\nMethods\n\nAfter forming an interprofessional study team and engaging key stakeholders, a multipronged intervention strategy was developed using the Model for Improvement. A urine bag screening pathway was created and implemented using Plan, Do, Study Act (PDSA) cycles for children aged 6 to 24 months being evaluated for UTIs. A urine bag sample with point-of-care (POC) urinalysis (UA) was integrated as a screening approach. The outcome measure was the rate of ED urine catheterizations, and balancing measures included ED LOS and RVs. Statistical process control methods were used for analysis.\n\nResults\n\nDuring the 3-year study period from January 2019 to June 2022, the ED catheterization rate successfully decreased from a baseline of 73.3% to 37.7% and was sustained for approximately 2 years. Unnecessary urine cultures requiring microbiology processing decreased from 79.8% to 40.7%. The ED LOS initially decreased; however, it increased by 17 minutes during the last 8 months of the study. There was no change in RVs.\n\nConclusion\n\nA urine bag screening pathway was successfully implemented to decrease unnecessary, invasive catheterizations for UTI screening in children with only a slight increase in ED LOS. In addition to the urine bag pathway, an ED nursing champion, strategic alignment, and broad provider engagement were all instrumental in the initiative's success.",

				"abstractNote": "Autoimmune neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of immune-mediated disorders of the peripheral nerves. Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) are the archetypal acute and chronic forms. Over the past few decades, pathogenic antibodies targeting antigens of the peripheral nervous system and driving peripheral nerve damage in selected patients have been described. Moreover, the detection of these antibodies has diagnostic and therapeutic implications that have prompted a modification of the GBS and CIDP diagnostic algorithms. GBS diagnosis is based in clinical criteria, and systematic testing of anti-ganglioside antibodies is not required. Nonetheless, a positive anti-ganglioside antibody test may support the clinical suspicion when diagnosis of GBS (GM1 IgG), Miller Fisher (GQ1b IgG), or acute sensory-ataxic (GD1b IgG) syndromes is uncertain. Antiâmyelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) IgM and anti-disialosyl IgM antibodies are key in the diagnosis of anti-MAG neuropathy and chronic ataxic neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, M-protein, cold agglutinins, and disialosyl antibodies spectrum neuropathies, respectively, and help differentiating these conditions from CIDP. Recently, the field has been boosted by the discovery of pathogenic antibodies targeting proteins of the node of Ranvier contactin-1, contactin-associated protein 1, and nodal and paranodal isoforms of neurofascin (NF140, NF186, or NF155). These antibodies define subgroups of patients with specific clinical (most importantly poor or partial response to conventional therapies and excellent response to anti-CD20 therapy) and pathologic (node of Ranvier disruption in the absence of inflammation) features that led to the definition of the âautoimmune nodopathyâ diagnostic category and to the incorporation of nodal/paranodal antibodies to clinical routine testing. The purpose of this review was to provide a practical vision for the general neurologist of the use of antibodies in the clinical assessment of autoimmune neuropathies.",
