        "abstractNote": "Hedonism, taken as a theoretical approach to life's value, says that a life is intrinsically or ultimately good or worthwhile according to and on account of the pleasure less the pain, or suffering, it contains.  Fred Feldman begins in roughly this place and then proceeds to formulate a whole family of 'hedonisms' designed to be immune to moralists' various objections, until finally we are treated to 'hedonisms' that are close extensional equivalents to even such paradigmatically anti-hedonistic views as G.E. Moore's.  For all the acute, ingenious, and concise disposal of many objections to hedonism that fill much of this clearly written, accessible, and often rewarding book, anyone who regards pleasure as ever an ultimate and unmediated value-maker, if only within some component of a pluralist value theory, will sense long before its end that this original guiding idea of hedonism has been left behind along the way. While Feldman's 'basic intrinsic value states' are all 'hedonistic' in that they include pleasure or pain, these need not be taken at their hedonic face value, since this may be 'adjusted' as various normative standards, such as the appropriateness of the pleasure or pain as a response to its object, may demand.  Old-style hedonism's intensity and duration of pleasure and pain are thus supplemented by extra dimensions as needed to yield value theories that satisfy the various objectors.  This strategy of reconciling hedonism with its opponents follows the pattern of Mill's privileging of culturally 'higher' pleasures.  Feldman defends Mill's and his own use of extra dimensions of value against Moore's charge, that this strategy actually abandons hedonism for value pluralism, by insisting that all 'basic intrinsic value states' in the resulting views are still pleasures and pains. However, the deeper worry that such views abandon hedonism's guiding idea that life is ultimately better by, and only by, containing more pleasure or less pain is never satisfactorily addressed, but seemingly defined away (177-81), despite an earlier concession that these views use nonhedonic normative standards in determining value (121).  Moreover, when subjects' desert of pleasure and pain is allowed to similarly adjust hedonic states' contribution to the value of worlds (although not of lives), the historical hedonists' insistence that the value of larger wholes supervenes on that of the individual lives they contain is jettisoned as well.  And this, unlike the earlier adjustment of pleasure's and pain's value within lives, is not merely offered to objectors but is proposed in our author's own voice.   While Feldman presents this progress from face-value to variously adjusted evaluations of hedonic episodes mainly as response to various normative objections to old-style hedonism, it may be more internally motivated and defended along lines opened by his earlier move from a feeling to an attitude view of pleasure.  For while feelings of pleasure and pain may be supposed Humean particulars good or bad in their isolable selves, attitudes are relational and essentially directed on their objects.  If pleasure and pain are essentially evaluative reactions to their objects, they may be evaluated by their objects' independent values or for their correctness in tracking these, rather than solely from the subject's side.  Such appraisal, however, seems alien to the hedonistic tradition Feldman claims to represent.   Feldman's own route to revising this tradition begins by following Sidgwick in taking introspection to rule out pleasure's consisting in any distinctive kind of feeling (79 & his earlier \"Two Questions about Pleasure\", cited there; 85n5), by which Feldman apparently means bodily feeling of some sensory kind (56).  That he is an ethicist, writing largely in response to discussions by ethicists, rather than by recent philosophers of mind, shows here, and leads him to run the risk of appearing to ridicule a mere straw man.  Even someone who regards pleasure and pain as representing internal bodily states should distinguish such 'hot' affective feeling from garden-variety sensation.  Still the doubt about there being any distinctive individuating quale (however affective rather than sensory) would remain.  'Sensory hedonism', we are told, is therefore unsatisfactory as an account of the unity of pleasure.  But if no distinctive sensation is always present when pleasure is, we are assured (taking the other side of what is often supposed an exhaustive dichotomy) that a special intrinsic-value-bearing propositional attitude of taking pleasure in something is.  It is in terms of this 'attitudinal pleasure' that Feldman formulates his hedonism about life's value; sensory pleasures and pains, in contrast, are neither bearers of intrinsic value nor are they essentially pleasures or pains of any kind, but they are contingently made sensory pleasures or pains as their subject takes attitudinal pleasure or pain at the time in the fact of their occurrence.  Thus both the seeming unity of pleasure and suffering and their apparent diversity are elegantly handled, the former by positing two unitary propositional attitudes and the latter by the diversity of their contingent objects (79-80 & \"Two Questions\").  It is the intensity with which these attitudes are held, not that of any qualitative sensation, that matters for our good or ill.  This account allows us to count as hedonically good a life lived without sensory pleasure by someone of 'Stoic' tastes who takes attitudinal pleasure in this.  And Epicurean 'static pleasure' may be understood as attitudinal pleasure toward the absence of [sensory?] pain and disturbance [attitudinal pain?] (97ff.).  (But a causal role for this attitude in producing a nonattitudinal static pleasure would work at least as well as an interpretation.  And that this absence by itself during life suffices for the greatest sustainable pleasure, by excluding the only possible impediments to life's inherent nonattitudinal pleasure, may be still closer to Epicurus' actual view.)   Since there is surely something right about placing the affects of pleasure and pain more on the reactive than on the stimulus side of the mind, Feldman seems right in identifying these with ways we take things, rather than with experiences we might react to in either way on different occasions, if these are the only options between which we must choose.  However, the suggested analogy with the likes of [occurrent rather than standing?] belief fails to hold with any generality.  We can believe, hope, or fear propositions regarding others as much as ones regarding ourselves and what happens at remote as well as at present or close times.  We similarly can take pleasure in others' successes and in facts about remote times.  If enjoying a sensation is (as Feldman suggests) having this same attitude toward the fact of its occurrence, why can we not enjoy others' sensations or suffer others' pains, if not as much as our own, then even a little, along with temporally remote sensations of our own?  While using oneself-now-centered propositions working like de se self-attributions (as Feldman's earlier work suggests) may motivate some degree of self- and  present-centeredness, and considerations about vividness of representation and singular reference may help more, it is not clear that such resources are sufficient to address the tensions in Feldman's uniform attitude view--tensions caused by his assimilation of pleasure in sensory and bodily activity to thought-mediated pleasure, which two the medieval intentionalist tradition he remotely follows (by way of  Brentano and Chisholm) had generally handled in different ways.    A line of thought going back to Anscombe  (\"On the Grammar of 'Enjoy'\", The Journal of Philosophy, 64, 1967; repr. in Collected Philosophical Papers, Vol. II) poses a more general problem for such single-propositional-attitude views of all pleasure and enjoyment.  Finding pleasure in an activity is not the same thing as taking pleasure in the fact that it occurs; indeed, we often do the one without the other.  Following Anscombe's example of riding: one may fail to enjoy exercising while simultaneously taking pleasure in the fact that this very exercising occurs.  But these seem, respectively, not-having and having the same token attitude, attitudinal pleasure then toward the same fact, on Feldman's view.  Such examples show that what Feldman counts as the same, enjoying an activity and enjoying the fact of its occurrence, are different.  Only the latter, as Anscombe points out, do we ordinarily call taking pleasure in a fact.  If we are to distinguish the two by saying that this second pleasure is to be understood as enjoying the further fact that we are contemplating the first fact, we violate our intuitive sense of what the content is of our taking pleasure in (as we say and think) the fact that we are exercising.  But Feldman relies on the ordinary sense in which we take pleasure in something and know that we do to motivate his view (56).   Feldman often writes loosely, not only of propositions, facts, and states of affairs (which may seem close enough) but also of sensations as among attitudinal pleasure's objects. This would relocate the tension into doubt whether any single attitude can have such logically diverse objects.  But his official view assimilates sensations and activities to the [centered?] propositions of their occurrence.  It would seem better to discriminate Anscombe's absent pleasure in riding from her actual pleasure in the fact of her riding through the different activities of riding and thinking, as Aristotle and the Scholastics might, thus counting the envisioning of a state of affairs as among the many activities that may be enjoyed, rather than as the general case.  The intentionality of pleasure might, most parsimoniously, be made derivative on that of such activities or acts, some of which clearly have objects but some perhaps not.  But even if pleasure always depends on some single attitude (perhaps toward these activities), we might still doubt along with Ockham that pleasure need always accompany this, as in his example of someone deeply depressed.    Most importantly, it cannot be assumed that in cases of apparently objectless mood an intentional object always lurks concealed.  Perhaps it does; but, then, perhaps a phenomenally conscious but not easily examined feeling may as well (or instead), and this, rather, is or unifies pleasure, as in the view that Feldman, following Sidgwick on introspectionist grounds, rejects.  (Perhaps pleasure is often or always inseparable from its function of directing our attention toward other things but away from itself.)  Psychologists who study mood regard it, as does common sense, as often objectless--and also regard our baseline affect as a major factor in our affective well-being.  Perhaps some philosopher taking a very narrow view of pleasure, as including only short-term responses to those stimuli we call \"pleasures\", can reject these as outside his purview.  But Feldman, who intends to give an account of all well-being, clearly cannot.  (Such cases are problematic not only for all intentional views of pleasure but also for activity views such as Aristotle's, when these are taken to have as wide a scope as Feldman's, although they do not rule out accounts that appeal to activity or representation that we need not be aware of as such.)  For all these reasons, the old-style 'Default Hedonism' Feldman misleadingly characterizes as 'sensory' and rejects on introspective grounds may be no worse off than the Intrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism for which he forsakes it.   On this same view of pleasure, as a single special propositional attitude, Feldman bases also his later constructions of 'hedonisms' that 'adjust' the value of 'episodes' of this attitudinal pleasure variously, as the case may be, according to their objects' Millian 'altitude', truth, worth, Moorean appropriateness for pleasure or pain, or Aristotelian merit.  Versions adjusting pleasure's value to privileged upward-tending, more varied, more uniform, or better narratively-structured global patterns of pleasure in a life are also considered, and masterfully dismissed, as are also objections based on false pleasures, on the ground that the objectors these would satisfy mistake contemplating the lives in question from an observer's point of view for imagining them from the inside.  Either the factors in question actually perturb the subjects, in which case hedonism will have already counted their hedonic effects, or else they do not, in which case also no further accommodation need be made.  Similar considerations are used to turn the point of counterexamples similar to Nozick's 'experience machine'.  Feldman is more sympathetic to the adjustment of the value of pleasure in terms of the worthiness of its objects, devaluing base and malicious ones, and this yields so-called Desert-Adjusted Intrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism.  However, he does not adopt it, suspecting that the objectors project their own tastes on the people in the examples.  But when evaluating worlds (although not lives), Feldman sees a need to accommodate Ross's moral-desert-based intuitions, adopting Subject's Desert-Adjusted Intrinsic Attitudinal Hedonism, which adjusts the hedonic values of pains to count them as more or less bad, and of pleasures to count them as more or less good, according to their subjects' just deserts.  Doing so involves taking intrinsic value, in the cases of lives and of worlds, to be different things (197-98).  The disparity of this procedure with the metaphysics of value that often underlies hedonism, from the Cyrenaics to the classical utilitarians, on which the intrinsic value of all larger wholes reduces to that of momentary experience, could not be more evident.  Neither could an ethical epistemology based in momentary apprehension of this value, as in Epicurus and Sidgwick, support the broader intuition-driven pure axiology, explicitly divorced from metaethics (14) and epistemology (206), that Feldman practices here.   This book begins admirably, clearly introducing, explaining, and illustrating its subject in a manner suited to a broad audience.  Its middle chapters, however, move on too quickly to applications from the view of pleasure on which they are founded.  (This is taken over from Feldman's papers, mostly collected in his Utilitarianism, Hedonism, and Desert, to which readers are sometimes referred for more argument and details.)  This foundation seems shaky, as we have seen, even close to its home ground, and does not plausibly extend to all of pleasure, construed broadly as positive affect constitutively contributing to affective well-being.  Moreover, if pleasure is in part or whole a psychobiological phenomenon, as it increasingly seems to be, its nature is not something to be stipulated in the interests of simplicity, elegance, versatility, and reconciliation in ethical theory.  To get pleasure right, then, all these virtues and Feldman's ingenuity in analysis and responding to objections may not suffice. Whether and how pleasure, in part or whole, is one kind of affective process or a plurality, with more, less, or no generic unity, and whether it is felt or intentional always or only sometimes, will be for science to decide or at least to inform.  Still this book remains valuable especially for its insightful discussion of many objections and alternatives to hedonism, from Plato to the present, and of Epicurus' attempts at its revision and Feldman's own--even as we must be wary of the dichotomous mold of sensations and propositional attitudes in which its contributions to moral psychology, value theory, and their histories are too often cast.",

        "abstractNote": "THIS IS NDPR'S LAST REVIEW FOR 2015.\nWE WILL RESUME PUBLICATION ON JANUARY 10, 2016\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS AND A MERRY NEW YEAR TO ALL OUR READERS!\n\n \nThe title and focus of this book is taken from a letter written by Locke in the last year of his life to Anthony Collins, warning him not to publish work on the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body:\nI desire you to stop your hand a little and forbear putting to press the two discourses you mention they are very touchy subjects at this time and that good man who is the author may for ought I know be crippled by those who will be sure to be offended at him right or wrong. (21 February 1704, CL VIII 206)[1]\nAs Nicholas Jolley notes, Locke's own treatment of these topics in the Essay concerning Human Understanding sparked a good bit of controversy, especially with one of his most well known critics, Edward Stillingfleet. That Jolley begins the book this way sets the stage for his approach to interpreting Locke. Jolley accepts both that Locke, although not a full-blown materialist like Collins or Hobbes, is a \"weak materialist\" committed to property dualism, and he sees what we find in the Essay generally as in the service of an encompassing polemic against Descartes. For example, Locke's commitment to weak materialism is an anti-Cartesian response to the view that the mind is an immaterial substance whose essence is thinking.\nAnother important motivation behind the book is to show that \"Locke is a theologian as well as a philosopher\" and that these \"touchy subjects,\" mostly neglected in the scholarship, play an important role in some of the most interesting aspects of Locke's metaphysics, such as the hypothesis that matter might think, how that can happen in virtue of God's superaddition of thinking to matter, how thinking matter is consistent with the argument for the existence of God, and the theory of personal identity. Locke's theological views on the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the dead can be seen to inform and shape these philosophical arguments. Such themes come into relief when more attention is paid to works of Locke's other than the Essay. It is impossible to do justice to the extent and intricacy of Jolley's arguments in so short a space. Perhaps I can be forgiven to provide only a mere model of how Jolley makes his case.\nJolley's interpretation of Locke's polemic against Descartes' view that thinking is the essence of an immaterial substance (chapters 1-2) is a good example of how he sees the importance of the issue of immortality to Locke's metaphysics of substance. Jolley (19) cites Margaret Wilson's insight that a Cartesian thinking substance can persist without any psychological continuity.[2] I can be the same thinking substance even through a complete change of beliefs, desires, and memories. As Leibniz noted,[3] Descartes' view of the immortality of a thinking substance does not include memory, sensibility, or anything particular to a person. Such a view of immortality, Jolley notes, is hardly morally significant and so misconceives something very important about immortality.\nCiting a journal entry from 20 February 1682, Jolley states, \"the target of Locke's criticism of Descartes is an argument, going back to Plato's Phaedo, which seeks to derive the soul's natural immortality from its status as an immaterial substance\" (28). But \"What is at issue [for Locke],\" argues Jolley, \"is not a state of bare substantial existence and duration, but 'a state of sensibility'\". Immortality must involve something more than \"a kind of indestructibility that is common to all substances\". As Locke says, \"to prove eternal duration may be without any perception is to prove noe other immortality of the soule than what belongs to one of Epicurus's atoms, viz. that it perpetually exists but has noe sense either of happyness or misery\" (29).[4] The bigger point, according to Jolley, is that Locke uses the premise that the mind does not always think (that thinking is not the essence of the soul) to sever the necessary connection between the immateriality of a substance and its immortality. Once the soul need not be immaterial to be immortal, room is made for what Jolley sees as Locke's commitment to \"weak materialism,\" a kind of materialism consistent with property dualism.\nAll three themes (weak materialism, the polemic against Descartes, and the importance of theological commitments) emerge again in Jolley's chapter 3 discussion of the cognitive abilities of animals. Jolley argues that by attacking the Cartesian dogmatic view that we are always thinking and that animals think not at all (33), Locke opens the door to a more generous view of animal consciousness, which serves the purpose of defending weak materialism, promoting the thinking matter hypothesis, and bolstering his theological ambitions (34). And, again, we don't see these purposes in Locke's arguments concerning animals until we consult (more carefully) writings other than the Essay. One example is Stillingfleet's direct objection to the thinking matter hypothesis: \"if it may be in the power of matter to think, how comes it to be so impossible for such organized bodies as the brutes have to enlarge their ideas by abstraction? (LW IV 468)\" (45).[5] One might remember that Locke sets the line between human and non-human animal thinking at the ability to have abstract ideas (II.xi.10-11).\nContrary to Stillingfleet's objection, as Jolley argues, it's not that thinking is a part of the natural powers of matter (45). Rather, divine superaddition accounts for how matter might think and easily accommodates Locke's view of the difference between animal and human mentality. Indeed, that superaddition plays this role is the best explanation of these differences. The reason why human mentality includes abstraction (as well as other more sophisticated activities) need not be because God has given immaterial substance to humans but not to animals, but rather that \"God gives different degrees of mental faculties to matter in human beings and animals\" (46). Furthermore, that God's superaddition would have this result is consistent with a metaphysics of weak materialism consistent with property dualism. Therefore, according to Jolley, it is Locke's anti-Cartesian arguments about the extent to which humans and animals think that are at the bottom of the thinking matter hypothesis.\nIn addition, we can see these arguments about the capacities of animals and the possibility of thinking matter to have theological ramifications. Jolley argues that Locke's responses to Stillingfleet (LW IV 466) in combination with a journal entry from 1682 show that Locke does not accept the Cartesian view that immortality is necessarily tied to immateriality (47-49). Indeed, someone with commitments both to sensation in animals and a necessary connection between immateriality and immortality faces a dilemma. Once one, in this case Stillingfleet, accepts that animals have sensation, then one must accept that either they have immaterial souls or they do not. On the one hand, if animals have immaterial souls, then one is led to accept that they must have immortal souls. But if one then denies immortality to animals, then one must deny immateriality as well, which opens the door to weak materialism -- that material things can think (have sensation). On the other hand, if one simply denies the necessary connection between immateriality and immortality, then \"a standard argument for the immortality of human beings [that they have immaterial souls] is blocked. Either way, Stillingfleet is forced to accept an unpalatable conclusion\" (49). And in either case, thinking matter (or weak materialism) gains ground as a possible metaphysics of substance.\nIn another way, Locke's thinking matter hypothesis, superaddition, and what it amounts to can be seen as a further exemplification of Locke's \"implicit, ongoing debate with Descartes\" (72). Developing a point made by Wilson,[6] Jolley, in chapter 5, argues that Locke can be seen to be \"turning Descartes' own weapons against him\" (74). Descartes admits that God can arbitrarily annex ideas to secondary qualities. What, then, would prohibit God from arbitrarily annexing thinking properties to matter? Once this possibility is acknowledged, it is hard to see how to avoid \"a slippery slope towards a weak form of materialism that is consistent with property dualism\" (74). Jolley admits that a Cartesian can reply that we have mutually exclusive clear and distinct ideas of matter and mind. Therefore, matter and mind are really distinct substances. But Locke can retort that, indeed, we do not have such clear and distinct ideas, for had we, there would be no problem understanding mind-body interaction. Jolley concludes, \"The price that Descartes pays for his dogmatic doctrine of the mind as an immaterial thinking substance is his commitment to the unintelligible action of body on mind\" (75). Locke's arguments should be seen as a clear exploitation of this price.\nOne of the most interesting arguments in support of weak materialism, in my view, is Jolley's reconciliation of apparently conflicting texts addressing the possibility that superaddition amounts to the emergence of thinking properties from matter. In IV.iii.6, Locke seems to say that not any matter has the power to think, but rather only \"some Systems of Matter fitly disposed.\" To say that matter so disposed can give rise to thinking, though, is to have a very weak notion of superaddition -- so weak, in fact, that very little role seems left for God to play. Seemingly, all God would have to do is arrange the particles and set them in motion.[7] In addition, Locke seems specifically to preclude the possibility that thinking properties are emergent from \"matter fitly disposed\": \"For unthinking Particles of Matter, however put together, can have nothing thereby added to them, but a new relation of Position, which 'tis impossible should give thought and knowledge to them\" (IV.x.16). Where in IV.iii.6 Locke seems sympathetic to some organizations of particles being fit for the capacity to think, in IV.x.16 he seems, as Jolley puts it, to \"dogmatically\" deny it (92). Jolley offers a solution both to the philosophical problem of establishing a suitable role for God in superaddition and to the textual conflict by arguing that \"God's action is necessary to give causal powers to matter for thinking, even when the particles are fitly disposed\" (92, my emphasis). Just as God cannot give to just any old matter (as Jolley says, a shoe or a turnip) the power of thinking (92), God must do something in order for thinking to emerge from a suitably organized system of matter. Although Jolley's solution is tempered by his view that \"Locke never seriously entertains any alternatives to property dualism,\" his analysis of the arguments in IV.iii.6 and IV.x is intricate, nuanced, and much more extensively considered than I have been able to show here.\nAs Jolley moves to the last two chapters on personal identity and mortalism, the theme of Locke's polemic with Descartes fades away and the importance of theological issues with respect to the defense of weak materialism takes center stage. Locke's theory of personal identity aims to make this theological point: the resurrection of a person entails neither the numerical sameness of an immaterial substance nor the numerical sameness of the body (100).\nOnce we see the importance of these theological concerns, two significant features of the theory become apparent: first, persons can have a gappy existence; second, 'person' is a \"Forensick,\" or moral term, referring to what receives merit or punishment (101), on the basis of what it can be conscious of, or remember, having done. That is, the same consciousness, says Locke, makes the same person (II.xxvii.10). But these two significant features result in a well-known tension: that we have a gappy existence due to an inability to be conscious of all we have done seems to cut against just punishment or reward for all that we do. To resolve this tension, a good bit of recent literature on Locke's theory of personal identity has included a philosophical account, via causal relations between an original experience and a later memory or appropriation of it, to provide Locke's theory with the assurance that we are the same person and so are punished justly.[8] Nevertheless, Jolley (100) says that if we want to understand Locke's \"purposes and motivations\" then we have to look \"with suspicion\" at those attempts to offer such \"friendly amendments\" because they \"run counter to Locke's theological motivations.\" So Locke wouldn't have accepted them. Therefore, Locke is happy \"to leave some loose ends dangling\" in his theory.\nJolley then targets John Mackie's \"friendly amendment\" to solve the tension as an example of something Locke would not accept due to his theological aims and commitments. Mackie argues that Locke need not worry about the possibility of being held responsible for a false memory -- say, that \"George IV falsely remembers having led his troops to victory at the battle of Waterloo\" -- for the theory is concerned with genuine (not pseudo) memory. A direct causal link can be forged between an occurrent memory experience and a later recollection of it. Jolley claims that such a fix won't work: \"on any ordinary understanding of causality, there can be no causal links between a memory experience at the Day of Judgment and an action or experience in this life; at least, any philosopher who maintains that there can be such causal links has a lot of explaining to do\" (102-103). Jolley doesn't say anything more about exactly why a causal link is impossible. He simply concludes that this sort of proposal is a non-starter due to Locke's commitment to the resurrection. \"As an analytic historian of philosophy uninterested in contextual matters, Mackie does not notice Locke's preoccupation with the issue of the Resurrection\" (103).\nJolley then argues that Mackie's failure to realize that a causal analysis won't work \"infects his account of Locke's discussion of transfers of consciousness\" (103) in the well-known passage from II.xxvii.13. I suppose Jolley means that because a causal account of how memories are genuine as opposed to false can't work, there is no distinction to be made. But still, Locke need not worry about the possibility of false memory, for once we appreciate the theological context we realize that such \"fatal errors\" leading to unjust punishment, as Locke calls them in II.xxvii.13, will be left up to the goodness of God to rectify. As Jolley says, \"With regard to some of the puzzle cases, we must simply take comfort from the fact that we are dealing with a just and good God\" (105). This is simply another of those philosophical \"loose ends\" Locke is willing to leave dangling due to his theological commitments.\nThere are certainly disagreements about how to interpret Locke's claims in II.xxvii.13 both with respect to what consciousness transference consists in and with respect to whether or not it can result in false memory. More importantly, there are more recent interpretations than Mackie's of a causal relation between an original experience and a later memory or appropriation of it that are on different sides of both of those fences. And some of these interpretations are quite sensitive to Locke's theological commitments, particularly divine rectification and/or the resurrection.[9] If it's the case that these particular loose ends need not be left dangling, then there might be a reason to think that friendly amendments in general need not be seen as suspect when it comes to understanding Locke's purposes and motivations. Perhaps the broader arguments in Locke's Touchy Subjects defending weak materialism, the anti-Cartesian polemic, and the theological motivation remain standing. Still, it seems desirable that if those friendly amendments in the scholarship are both philosophically and textually justified, then Locke (and Jolley), all things considered, might be better off taking them on board.\nAll in all, Locke's Touchy Subjects is a provocative reading of Locke that puts due focus on some of the less attended to writings. There are some very intriguing and persuasive arguments woven together from what we find in the Essay and other writings, especially supporting an interpretation of Locke as making room for weak materialism consistent with property dualism. Jolley portrays Locke the theist and the philosopher committed both to scripture and to some very unorthodox (and even revolutionary) philosophical ideas.\n\n\n\n[1] All references to Locke's Essay are to ed.
