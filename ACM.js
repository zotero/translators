Such systems facilitate collaboration with and concurrent contribution to shared source code by large developer bases. In this work, we investigate a framework for \"performance-aware\" repository and revision control for Java programs. Our system automatically tracks behavioral differences across revisions to provide developers with feedback as to how their change impacts performance of the application. It does so as part of the repository commit process by profiling the performance of the program or component, and performing automatic analyses that identify differences in the dynamic behavior or performance between two code revisions. In this paper, we present our system that is based upon and extends prior work on calling context tree (CCT) profiling and performance differencing. Our framework couples the use of precise CCT information annotated with performance metrics and call-site information, with a simple tree comparison technique and novel heuristics that together target the cause of performance differences between code revisions without knowledge of program semantics. We evaluate the efficacy of the framework using a number of open source Java applications and present a case study in which we use the framework to distinguish two revisions of the popular FindBugs application.",

Git permits virtually an infinite variety of methods for development and collaboration. Created by Linus Torvalds to manage development of the Linux kernel, it's become the principal tool for distributed version control. But Git's flexibility also means that some users don't understand how to use it to their best advantage. Version Control with Git offers tutorials on the most effective ways to use it, as well as friendly yet rigorous advice to help you navigate Git's many functions. With this book, you will: Learn how to use Git in several real-world development environments Gain insight into Git's common-use cases, initial tasks, and basic functions Understand how to use Git for both centralized and distributed version control Use Git to manage patches, diffs, merges, and conflicts Acquire advanced techniques such as rebasing, hooks, and ways to handle submodules (subprojects) Learn how to use Git with Subversion Git has earned the respect of developers around the world.

A new\nyield model for boards and MCMs which accounts for the\nclustering of solder defects is introduced and used to\npredict the yield at each test step. In addition, MTSIM\nestimates the average number of defects per board detected at each\ntest step, and estimates costs incurred in test execution, fault\nisolation and repair.

				"abstractNote": "Fran (Functional Reactive Animation) is a collection of data types and functions for composing richly interactive, multimedia animations. The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to effectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving gravity, springs, velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary differential equations.",
