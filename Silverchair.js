A number of recent articles have found that two types of factors encourage politicians to liberalize their capital accounts: strong macroeconomic fundamentals and political pressure from proponents of open capital markets. However, these conclusions need to be re-evaluated because the most commonly used measure of capital account openness, Chinn and Ito's (2002) Kaopen index, suffers from systematic measurement error. We modify the Chinn–Ito variable and replicate two studies (Brooks and Kurtz 2007; Chwieroth 2007) to demonstrate that our improved measure overturns some prior findings. Some political variables have stronger effects on capital account policy than previously recognized, while macroeconomic fundamentals are less important than previous research suggests.",

Some conflicts reach the Council's agenda within days after they start, others after years (or even decades), and some never make it. So far, only a few studies have looked at the crucial UNSC agenda-setting stage, and none have examined agenda-setting speed. To fill this important gap, we develop and test a novel theoretical framework that combines insights from realist and constructivist theory with lessons from institutionalist theory and bargaining theory. Applying survival analysis to an original dataset, we show that the parochial interests of the permanent members (P-5) matter, but they do not determine the Council's agenda-setting speed. Rather, P-5 interests are constrained by normative considerations and concerns for the Council's organizational mission arising from the severity of a conflict (in terms of spillover effects and civilian casualties); by the interests of the widely ignored elected members (E-10); and by the degree of preference heterogeneity among both the P-5 and the E-10. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how the United Nations (UN) works, and they have implications for the UN's legitimacy.",

				"abstractNote": "Why do states build new international organizations (IOs) in issue areas where many institutions already exist? Prevailing theories of institutional creation emphasize their ability to resolve market failures, but adding new IOs can increase uncertainty and rule inconsistency. I argue that institutional proliferation occurs when existing IOs fail to adapt to shifts in state power. Member states expect decision-making rules to reflect their underlying power; when it does not, they demand greater influence in the organization. Subsequent bargaining over the redistribution of IO influence often fails due to credibility and information problems. As a result, under-represented states construct new organizations that provide them with greater institutional control. To test this argument, I examine the proliferation of multilateral development banks since 1944. I leverage a novel identification strategy rooted in the allocation of World Bank votes at Bretton Woods to show that the probability of institutional proliferation is higher when power is misaligned in existing institutions. My results suggest that conflict over shifts in global power contribute to the fragmentation of global governance.",

				"abstractNote": "Mechanoreceptor cells develop a specialized cytoskeleton that plays structural and sensory roles at the site of mechanotransduction. However, little is known about how the cytoskeleton is organized and formed. Using electron tomography and live-cell imaging, we resolve the 3D structure and dynamics of the microtubule-based cytoskeleton in fly campaniform mechanosensory cilia. Investigating the formation of the cytoskeleton, we find that katanin p60-like 1 (kat-60L1), a neuronal type of microtubule-severing enzyme, serves two functions. First, it amplifies the mass of microtubules to form the dense microtubule arrays inside the sensory cilia. Second, it generates short microtubules that are required to build the nanoscopic cytoskeleton at the mechanotransduction site. Additional analyses further reveal the functional roles of Patronin and other potential factors in the local regulatory network. In all, our results characterize the specialized cytoskeleton in fly external mechanosensory cilia at near-molecular resolution and provide mechanistic insights into how it is formed.",

What information is encoded, and what is lost in the visual periphery? A systematic way to answer this question is to determine how sensitive the visual system is to different kinds of lossy image changes compared to the unmodified natural scene. If modified images are indiscriminable from the original scene, then the information discarded by the modification is not important for perception under the experimental conditions used. We measured the detectability of modifications of natural image structure using a temporal three-alternative oddity task, in which observers compared modified images to original natural scenes. We consider two lossy image transformations, Gaussian blur and Portilla and Simoncelli texture synthesis. Although our paradigm demonstrates metamerism (physically different images that appear the same) under some conditions, in general we find that humans can be capable of impressive sensitivity to deviations from natural appearance. The representations we examine here do not preserve all the information necessary to match the appearance of natural scenes in the periphery.",
