**READ THIS BEFORE CREATING AN ISSUE**

Zotero generally does not use GitHub Issues for bug reports or feature requests regarding Zotero software.

If you’re sure you’ve identified a bug in a specific Zotero translator, you’re welcome to create an issue here.

Otherwise, please post all requests to the Zotero Forums at https://forums.zotero.org, where Zotero developers and many others can help. For confirmed bugs or agreed-upon changes, Zotero developers will create new issues in the relevant repositories.

Development questions involving code, APIs, or other technical topics can be posted to the zotero-dev mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/zotero-dev.

See https://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_support for more information on how Zotero support works.
