As the New Basel Accord is to be implemented globally, the banking industry will en counter increasing competition and need to improve the quality of the assets. Many banks will be confronted with the dilemma of reducing default rates and increasing return rates (on assets and on equity). Since small-scale consumers loans are relatively profitable and their risks are more diversified, they are preferred in accreditation over business loans. Because the cohort study reflects the study design of the real date, which is stipulated in the New Basel Capital Accord, the above findings can serve as reference for assessing credit risk, whereas these findings would not be obtained in the previous case-control studies. This research intends to use a retro-prospective cohort to analyze the significance of factors affecting default behavior. Unlike previous case-control studies, the cohort study can assess some elements of credit risk. There are two findings in this study. First, the sample sizes would affect the number and the choice of the explanatory variables in logistic regression models. Second, the predicted power increases significantly with the sample sizes.",

The phenomenon, analyzed by DMFT, was related to the accumulated risk factors. However, caries risk factors in different growing periods would be various. Prospective follow-up study was used to analyze the risk factors of caries owing to the complex of forming and the multi-origin characteristics. The researcher adopted prospective follow-up study to compare and analyze the new contemporaneous incidence of caries and the influence factors.\nAim:\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship among new oral incidence of caries, oral health behavior, and related factors.\nMethods:\nProspective follow-up study was assumed in this study. Study participants were recruited from first grader to fifth grader of a primary school in Kaohsiung County .For each grade, 3 classes were randomly selected, questionnaired, and orally examined with finally a total of 504 subjects. After 10 months of following-up, students who couldn’t participate thoroughly or transferred to other schools during the study were excluded. A total of 475 subjects (male: 261; female:214) remained with the completion rate of 94.25% of the posttest.  \nResult:\nThe result showed an increase of 0.35 on mean DMFT index, 0.45 (p < .0001, p < .0001) on DMFS index, and 5.00 (p = 0.0450) on filling rate of permanent teeth in this 10-month prospective follow-up study. The increase of DMFT index reached the peak of 0.46 at the age of 9, and then gently steadied by the addition of age. Overall, a statistically significant difference showed in the study. On the aspect of gender, higher DMFT index and DMFS index were presented on girl students, whose caries status augmented when the age increased. After the adjustment of important influence factors the pretest of DMFT index, gender education, sweet habit, timing of cleaning teeth, and the dental clinic experience in the Multiple Regression Analysis, the researcher found a strong relation between father’s education and the filling rates of the caries of permanent teeth on pretest and posttest. Meanwhile, domestic factors were the key to influence oral health of school children. \nDiscussion and Conclusion:\nThe DMFT index of permanent teeth was higher on boys than on girls, same as the prevalence. The result of filling rate indicated girls’ filling rate was higher than boys’. The behavior of cleaning teeth on school children could effectively lessen the occurring of caries. Cleaning teeth after meal and after sweet lowered the DMFT index and the caries incidence. \nSuggestion:\nOral health was an inevitable, long-term, and continual promotion job.Therefore, health promotion should focus not only on physical condition and health-related behaviors but also on the relationship among health, health-related behaviors, and environment.",
