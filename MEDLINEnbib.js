Adenylyl-imidodiphosphate is bound to one beta-subunit\n      (betaTP), ADP is bound to the second (betaDP), and no nucleotide is bound to the \n      third (betaE). Here we show that the uncompetitive inhibitor aurovertin B binds\n      to bovine F1 at two equivalent sites in betaTP and betaE, in a cleft between the \n      nucleotide binding and C-terminal domains. In betaDP, the aurovertin B pocket is \n      incomplete and is inaccessible to the inhibitor. The aurovertin B bound to betaTP\n      interacts with alpha-Glu399 in the adjacent alphaTP subunit, whereas the\n      aurovertin B bound to betaE is too distant from alphaE to make an equivalent\n      interaction. Both sites encompass betaArg-412, which was shown by mutational\n      studies to be involved in binding aurovertin. Except for minor changes around the\n      aurovertin pockets, the structure of bovine F1-ATPase is the same as determined\n      previously.

In this report, affinity purification techniques were\n      used to identify the GTPase dynamin as an SH3 domain-binding protein. Selective\n      binding to a subset of 15 different recombinant SH3 domains occurs through\n      proline-rich sequence motifs similar to those that mediate the interaction of the\n      SH3 domains of Grb2 and Abl proteins to the guanine nucleotide exchange protein, \n      Sos, and to the 3BP1 protein, respectively. Dynamin GTPase activity is stimulated\n      by several of the bound SH3 domains, suggesting that the function of the SH3\n      module is not restricted to protein-protein interactions but may also include the\n      interactive regulation of GTP-binding proteins.\nFAU - Gout, I\nAU  - Gout I\nAD  - Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, England.\nFAU - Dhand, R\nAU  - Dhand R\nFAU - Hiles, I D\nAU  - Hiles ID\nFAU - Fry, M J\nAU  - Fry MJ\nFAU - Panayotou, G\nAU  - Panayotou G\nFAU - Das, P\nAU  - Das P\nFAU - Truong, O\nAU  - Truong O\nFAU - Totty, N F\nAU  - Totty NF\nFAU - Hsuan, J\nAU  - Hsuan J\nFAU - Booker, G W\nAU  - Booker GW\nAU  - et al.\nLA  - eng\nPT  - Comparative Study\nPT  - Journal Article\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\nPL  - UNITED STATES\nTA  - Cell\nJT  - Cell\nJID - 0413066\nRN  - 0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)\nRN  - 0 (Recombinant Proteins)\nRN  - EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)\nRN  - EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)\nRN  - EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)\nSB  - IM\nMH  - Amino Acid Sequence\nMH  - Animals\nMH  - Binding Sites\nMH  - Brain/*enzymology\nMH  - Drosophila/genetics\nMH  - Dynamins\nMH  - Enzyme Activation\nMH  - GTP Phosphohydrolases/isolation & purification/*metabolism\nMH  - Glutathione Transferase/metabolism\nMH  - Humans\nMH  - Kinetics\nMH  - Mice\nMH  - Molecular Sequence Data\nMH  - Rats\nMH  - Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism\nMH  - Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism\nMH  - Sequence Homology, Amino Acid\nMH  - Signal Transduction\nEDAT- 1993/10/08\nMHDA- 1993/10/08 00:01\nCRDT- 1993/10/08 00:00\nAID - 0092-8674(93)90676-H [pii]\nPST - ppublish\nSO  - Cell. 1993 Oct 8;75(1):25-36.",

				"abstractNote": "Src homology 3 (SH3) domains have been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions in receptor signaling processes; however, the precise role of this domain remains unclear. In this report, affinity purification techniques were used to identify the GTPase dynamin as an SH3 domain-binding protein. Selective binding to a subset of 15 different recombinant SH3 domains occurs through proline-rich sequence motifs similar to those that mediate the interaction of the SH3 domains of Grb2 and Abl proteins to the guanine nucleotide exchange protein,  Sos, and to the 3BP1 protein, respectively. Dynamin GTPase activity is stimulated by several of the bound SH3 domains, suggesting that the function of the SH3 module is not restricted to protein-protein interactions but may also include the interactive regulation of GTP-binding proteins.",

This study investigated the impact of public\n      health practices to prevent SBS/AHT in Japan through the use of educational\n      materials. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The intervention was\n      comprised of two parts: (1) the screening of an educational DVD at a prenatal\n      class; and (2) the distribution of a public health pamphlet at a postnatal home\n      visit. Expectant parents watched a DVD (The Period of PURPLE Crying) about the\n      features of infant crying and recommended behaviours (walking away if frustrated \n      in the event of unsoothable crying, sharing information on crying with other\n      caregivers) at a preterm parenting class held at eight months' gestation. A\n      postnatal home-visit service was implemented in which a maternity nurse\n      distributed a pamphlet to explain information about infant crying. Before the\n      four-month health check-up, a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to \n      assess exposure to these public health practices and outcome variables (i.e.\n      infant crying knowledge, walk-away and information-sharing behaviours), and\n      responses were collected at the four-month health check-up (n = 1316). The\n      impacts of these interventions on outcome variables were analysed by comparing\n      those exposed to both interventions, either intervention and neither intervention\n      after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Crying and shaking knowledge were\n      significantly higher among women exposed to the public health practices, with a\n      dose-response relationship (both P < 0.001). Further, walk-away behaviour during \n      periods of unsoothable crying was higher among the intervention group. However,\n      sharing information about infant crying with other caregivers was less likely\n      among the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of educational materials in\n      public health practice on knowledge of crying and shaking, and walk-away\n      behaviour in Japan had a dose-response relationship; however, an increase in\n      sharing information with other caregivers was not observed.\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.

This assumption, however, has not been verified in the field of language testing. Building on expectancy-value theory, this study explored the relationships between test-taker perception, test-taking motivation, and test performance in the context of a computer-delivered speaking test. Methods: Sixty-four Japanese university students took the TOEIC Speaking test and completed a questionnaire that included statements about their test perception, test-taking motivation, and self-perceived test performance. Five students participated in follow-up interviews. Results: Questionnaire results showed that students regarded the TOEIC Speaking test positively in terms of test validity but showed reservations about computer delivery, and that they felt sufficiently motivated during the test. Interview results revealed various reasons for their reservations about computer delivery and factors that distracted them during the test. According to correlation analysis, the effects of test-taker perception and test-taking motivation seemed to be minimal on test performance, and participants' perception of computer delivery was directly related to test-taking effort, but their perception of test validity seemed to be related to test-taking effort only indirectly through the mediation of perceived test importance. Conclusion: Our findings not only provide empirical evidence for the relationship between test-taker perception and test performance but also highlight the importance of considering test-taker reactions in developing tests.\nISSN - EISSN-2229-0443\nLA  - English\nPT  - Journal Articles\nPT  - Reports - Research\n\nOWN - ERIC\nTI  - College Entrance Exams: How Does Test Preparation Affect Retest Scores?
