Adenylyl-imidodiphosphate is bound to one beta-subunit\n      (betaTP), ADP is bound to the second (betaDP), and no nucleotide is bound to the \n      third (betaE). Here we show that the uncompetitive inhibitor aurovertin B binds\n      to bovine F1 at two equivalent sites in betaTP and betaE, in a cleft between the \n      nucleotide binding and C-terminal domains. In betaDP, the aurovertin B pocket is \n      incomplete and is inaccessible to the inhibitor. The aurovertin B bound to betaTP\n      interacts with alpha-Glu399 in the adjacent alphaTP subunit, whereas the\n      aurovertin B bound to betaE is too distant from alphaE to make an equivalent\n      interaction. Both sites encompass betaArg-412, which was shown by mutational\n      studies to be involved in binding aurovertin. Except for minor changes around the\n      aurovertin pockets, the structure of bovine F1-ATPase is the same as determined\n      previously. Aurovertin B appears to act by preventing closure of the catalytic\n      interfaces, which is essential for a catalytic mechanism involving cyclic\n      interconversion of catalytic sites.\nFAU - van Raaij, M J\nAU  - van Raaij MJ\nAD  - Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United\n      Kingdom.\nFAU - Abrahams, J P\nAU  - Abrahams JP\nFAU - Leslie, A G\nAU  - Leslie AG\nFAU - Walker, J E\nAU  - Walker JE\nLA  - eng\nPT  - Journal Article\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\nPL  - UNITED STATES\nTA  - Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A\nJT  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\nJID - 7505876\nRN  - 0 (Aurovertins)\nRN  - 0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)\nRN  - 0 (Macromolecular Substances)\nRN  - 25612-73-1 (Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate)\nRN  - 3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)\nRN  - 55350-03-3 (aurovertin B)\nRN  - 94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)\nRN  - EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)\nSB  - IM\nMH  - Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate/pharmacology\nMH  - Animals\nMH  - Arginine\nMH  - Aurovertins/*chemistry/*metabolism\nMH  - Binding Sites\nMH  - Cattle\nMH  - Crystallography, X-Ray\nMH  - Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism\nMH  - Glutamic Acid\nMH  - Macromolecular Substances\nMH  - Models, Molecular\nMH  - Molecular Structure\nMH  - Myocardium/enzymology\nMH  - *Protein Structure, Secondary\nMH  - Proton-Translocating ATPases/*chemistry/*metabolism\nPMC - PMC38908\nOID - NLM: PMC38908\nEDAT- 1996/07/09\nMHDA- 1996/07/09 00:01\nCRDT- 1996/07/09 00:00\nPST - ppublish\nSO  - Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jul 9;93(14):6913-7.\n\nPMID- 21249755\nSTAT- Publisher\nDA  - 20110121\nDRDT- 20080809\nCTDT- 20080718\nPB  - National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)\nDP  - 2009\nTI  - Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome\nBTI - Cancer Syndromes\nAB  - PJS is a rare disease.

This study investigated the impact of public\n      health practices to prevent SBS/AHT in Japan through the use of educational\n      materials. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The intervention was\n      comprised of two parts: (1) the screening of an educational DVD at a prenatal\n      class; and (2) the distribution of a public health pamphlet at a postnatal home\n      visit. Expectant parents watched a DVD (The Period of PURPLE Crying) about the\n      features of infant crying and recommended behaviours (walking away if frustrated \n      in the event of unsoothable crying, sharing information on crying with other\n      caregivers) at a preterm parenting class held at eight months' gestation. A\n      postnatal home-visit service was implemented in which a maternity nurse\n      distributed a pamphlet to explain information about infant crying. Before the\n      four-month health check-up, a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to \n      assess exposure to these public health practices and outcome variables (i.e.\n      infant crying knowledge, walk-away and information-sharing behaviours), and\n      responses were collected at the four-month health check-up (n = 1316). The\n      impacts of these interventions on outcome variables were analysed by comparing\n      those exposed to both interventions, either intervention and neither intervention\n      after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Crying and shaking knowledge were\n      significantly higher among women exposed to the public health practices, with a\n      dose-response relationship (both P < 0.001). Further, walk-away behaviour during \n      periods of unsoothable crying was higher among the intervention group. However,\n      sharing information about infant crying with other caregivers was less likely\n      among the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of educational materials in\n      public health practice on knowledge of crying and shaking, and walk-away\n      behaviour in Japan had a dose-response relationship; however, an increase in\n      sharing information with other caregivers was not observed.\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.
