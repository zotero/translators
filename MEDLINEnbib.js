Adenylyl-imidodiphosphate is bound to one beta-subunit\n      (betaTP), ADP is bound to the second (betaDP), and no nucleotide is bound to the \n      third (betaE). Here we show that the uncompetitive inhibitor aurovertin B binds\n      to bovine F1 at two equivalent sites in betaTP and betaE, in a cleft between the \n      nucleotide binding and C-terminal domains. In betaDP, the aurovertin B pocket is \n      incomplete and is inaccessible to the inhibitor. The aurovertin B bound to betaTP\n      interacts with alpha-Glu399 in the adjacent alphaTP subunit, whereas the\n      aurovertin B bound to betaE is too distant from alphaE to make an equivalent\n      interaction. Both sites encompass betaArg-412, which was shown by mutational\n      studies to be involved in binding aurovertin. Except for minor changes around the\n      aurovertin pockets, the structure of bovine F1-ATPase is the same as determined\n      previously. Aurovertin B appears to act by preventing closure of the catalytic\n      interfaces, which is essential for a catalytic mechanism involving cyclic\n      interconversion of catalytic sites.\nFAU - van Raaij, M J\nAU  - van Raaij MJ\nAD  - Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United\n      Kingdom.\nFAU - Abrahams, J P\nAU  - Abrahams JP\nFAU - Leslie, A G\nAU  - Leslie AG\nFAU - Walker, J E\nAU  - Walker JE\nLA  - eng\nPT  - Journal Article\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\nPL  - UNITED STATES\nTA  - Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A\nJT  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\nJID - 7505876\nRN  - 0 (Aurovertins)\nRN  - 0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)\nRN  - 0 (Macromolecular Substances)\nRN  - 25612-73-1 (Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate)\nRN  - 3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)\nRN  - 55350-03-3 (aurovertin B)\nRN  - 94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)\nRN  - EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)\nSB  - IM\nMH  - Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate/pharmacology\nMH  - Animals\nMH  - Arginine\nMH  - Aurovertins/*chemistry/*metabolism\nMH  - Binding Sites\nMH  - Cattle\nMH  - Crystallography, X-Ray\nMH  - Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism\nMH  - Glutamic Acid\nMH  - Macromolecular Substances\nMH  - Models, Molecular\nMH  - Molecular Structure\nMH  - Myocardium/enzymology\nMH  - *Protein Structure, Secondary\nMH  - Proton-Translocating ATPases/*chemistry/*metabolism\nPMC - PMC38908\nOID - NLM: PMC38908\nEDAT- 1996/07/09\nMHDA- 1996/07/09 00:01\nCRDT- 1996/07/09 00:00\nPST - ppublish\nSO  - Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jul 9;93(14):6913-7.\n\nPMID- 21249755\nSTAT- Publisher\nDA  - 20110121\nDRDT- 20080809\nCTDT- 20080718\nPB  - National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)\nDP  - 2009\nTI  - Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome\nBTI - Cancer Syndromes\nAB  - PJS is a rare disease.

This study investigated the impact of public\n      health practices to prevent SBS/AHT in Japan through the use of educational\n      materials. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The intervention was\n      comprised of two parts: (1) the screening of an educational DVD at a prenatal\n      class; and (2) the distribution of a public health pamphlet at a postnatal home\n      visit. Expectant parents watched a DVD (The Period of PURPLE Crying) about the\n      features of infant crying and recommended behaviours (walking away if frustrated \n      in the event of unsoothable crying, sharing information on crying with other\n      caregivers) at a preterm parenting class held at eight months' gestation. A\n      postnatal home-visit service was implemented in which a maternity nurse\n      distributed a pamphlet to explain information about infant crying. Before the\n      four-month health check-up, a self-administered questionnaire was distributed to \n      assess exposure to these public health practices and outcome variables (i.e.\n      infant crying knowledge, walk-away and information-sharing behaviours), and\n      responses were collected at the four-month health check-up (n = 1316). The\n      impacts of these interventions on outcome variables were analysed by comparing\n      those exposed to both interventions, either intervention and neither intervention\n      after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Crying and shaking knowledge were\n      significantly higher among women exposed to the public health practices, with a\n      dose-response relationship (both P < 0.001). Further, walk-away behaviour during \n      periods of unsoothable crying was higher among the intervention group. However,\n      sharing information about infant crying with other caregivers was less likely\n      among the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of educational materials in\n      public health practice on knowledge of crying and shaking, and walk-away\n      behaviour in Japan had a dose-response relationship; however, an increase in\n      sharing information with other caregivers was not observed.\nCI  - Copyright (c) 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.

This assumption, however, has not been verified in the field of language testing. Building on expectancy-value theory, this study explored the relationships between test-taker perception, test-taking motivation, and test performance in the context of a computer-delivered speaking test. Methods: Sixty-four Japanese university students took the TOEIC Speaking test and completed a questionnaire that included statements about their test perception, test-taking motivation, and self-perceived test performance. Five students participated in follow-up interviews. Results: Questionnaire results showed that students regarded the TOEIC Speaking test positively in terms of test validity but showed reservations about computer delivery, and that they felt sufficiently motivated during the test. Interview results revealed various reasons for their reservations about computer delivery and factors that distracted them during the test. According to correlation analysis, the effects of test-taker perception and test-taking motivation seemed to be minimal on test performance, and participants' perception of computer delivery was directly related to test-taking effort, but their perception of test validity seemed to be related to test-taking effort only indirectly through the mediation of perceived test importance. Conclusion: Our findings not only provide empirical evidence for the relationship between test-taker perception and test performance but also highlight the importance of considering test-taker reactions in developing tests.\nISSN - EISSN-2229-0443\nLA  - English\nPT  - Journal Articles\nPT  - Reports - Research\n\nOWN - ERIC\nTI  - College Entrance Exams: How Does Test Preparation Affect Retest Scores?

In this paper, the authors examine the impact of participating in test preparation prior to retaking the ACT test. The study focused on addressing three questions: (1) Using a pretest-posttest design, do students who participate in test preparation have larger score gains relative to students who did not participate in test preparation; does the test preparation effect depend on students' pretest scores?; (2) Among students who participated in test preparation, is the number of hours spent participating in each of 10 test preparation activities related to retest scores?; and (3) Among students who participated in test preparation, do their own beliefs that they might have been ill-prepared to take the test, regardless of the test preparation activities they engaged in, impact retest scores? The study findings showed that test preparation improved students' retest scores, and this effect did not differ depending on students' first ACT score. Among specific test prep activities, only the number of hours using a private tutor resulted in increased score gains above the overall effect of test prep. Students who reported feeling inadequately prepared for the second test had ACT Composite scores that were lower than those students who felt adequately prepared.\nPT  - Reports - Research",

In this paper, the authors examine the impact of participating in test preparation prior to retaking the ACT test. The study focused on addressing three questions: (1) Using a pretest-posttest design, do students who participate in test preparation have larger score gains relative to students who did not participate in test preparation; does the test preparation effect depend on students' pretest scores?; (2) Among students who participated in test preparation, is the number of hours spent participating in each of 10 test preparation activities related to retest scores?; and (3) Among students who participated in test preparation, do their own beliefs that they might have been ill-prepared to take the test, regardless of the test preparation activities they engaged in, impact retest scores? The study findings showed that test preparation improved students' retest scores, and this effect did not differ depending on students' first ACT score. Among specific test prep activities, only the number of hours using a private tutor resulted in increased score gains above the overall effect of test prep. Students who reported feeling inadequately prepared for the second test had ACT Composite scores that were lower than those students who felt adequately prepared.",

The PISA-D school-based tests and contextual questionnaires are being piloted in eight countries: Bhutan, Cambodia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Paraguay, Senegal, and Zambia.

The PISA-D school-based assessment field trial reveals that the instruments work as intended. Findings from the analysis of the PISA-D cognitive test field trial data are organised around three major goals and are summarised in the table provided. The test covers reading, mathematics and science.

An exploratory factor analysis identified five clear factors including engagement in problem solving, progress, strategic flexibility, strategic efficiency, and speed. Regression analyses reveal that after accounting for behavior within the app, playing the gamified version of the app contributed to higher learning gains than playing a nongamified version.

Researchers make claims about whether the top-performing systems have transferable practices or policies that could be applied to the United States. However, looking only at top-performing education systems may omit important knowledge that could be applied from countries with similar demographic, geographic, linguistic, or economic characteristics--even if these countries do not perform highly on comparative assessments. Moreover, by exploring only the top performers, a presumption exists that these international assessments are in alignment with a country's curricular, pedagogic, political, and economic goals, which may falsely lead to the conclusion that by copying top performers, test scores would invariably increase and also meet the nation's needs. While international comparative assessments can be valuable when developing national or state policies, the way in which they are interpreted can be broadened cautiously to better inform their interpretability, relevance, and application to countries such as the United States--all while considering the purpose of each international assessment in the context of a nation's priorities. Ultimately, this report serves as a reference guide for various international assessments, as well as a review of literature that explores a possible relationship between national economies and international assessment performance. In addition, this review will discuss how policymakers might use international assessment results from various systems to adapt successful policies in the United States.

This study involved selecting three high-impact papers which featured open data and utilized bioinformatic analyses but provided no source code and refactoring these to allow external survey participants to swap tools, parameters, and data subsets to evaluate the robustness and underlying validity of these analyses. Technical advances that have taken place in recent years--scientific computing infrastructure has matured to support the distribution of reproducible computational analyses--enable this approach. These advances, along with cultural shifts encompassing open data and open code initiatives, promise to address technical stumbling blocks that have contributed to the \"reproducibility crisis.\" To take full advantage of these developments toward improving scientific quality, authors, reviewers, and publishers must integrate reproducible analysis into the peer review process. Seven existing major case study types - reproduction, replication, refactor, robustness test, survey, census, and case narrative - have been invaluable toward establishing reproducibility as a serious and independent area of research. Of particular interest are refactors, in which an existing analysis with abstract methods is reimplemented by a third party, and robustness tests, which involve the manipulation of tools, parameters, and data to assess the scientific validity of an analysis. This thesis describes efforts to test the feasibility of robustness testing in the context of in silico peer review. The contributions described are complemented with extensive source code. Design and Methods: A multi-method approach was employed for this study consisting of user surveys and tests of robustness--hands-on, self-directed software development exercises. Three high-impact genomics publications with open data, but no source code, were selected, refactored, and distributed to active study participants who acted as quasi-external reviewers. The process of the refactor was used to evaluate the limitations of reproducibility using conventional tools and to study how best to present analyses for peer review, and the tests of robustness were employed under the hypothesis this practice would help to evaluate the underlying validity of an analysis. Three different approaches were taken in these tests of robustness--a faithful reproduction of the original manuscript into a framework that could be manipulated by participants, a workflow-library approach in which participants were encouraged to employ modern \"off-the-shelf\" pre-built pipelines to triangulate tests, and an advisor-led approach in which senior experts suggested alternate tools to be implemented and I generated a report for their evaluation. Findings: The refactors and tests of robustness produced numerous discoveries both in terms of the underlying scientific content and, more importantly, into the strengths and weakness of the three robustness approaches (faithful/workflow-library/advisor-led) and pain points in the analytic stack, which may be addressed with appropriate software and metadata. The principal findings are that the faithful approach may often discourage aggressive robustness testing because of the inertia imposed by the existing framework, the workflow-library approach is efficient but can prove inconclusive, and the advisor-led approach may be most practical for journals but requires a higher level of communication to be effective. The vast majority of time in all these refactors was spent on sample metadata management, particularly organizing sample groups of biological and technical replicates to produce the numerous and varied tool input manifests. Practical Implications: Reproducibility-enabled in silico peer review is substantially more time-consuming than traditional manuscript peer review and will require economic, cultural, and technical change to bring to reality. The work presented here could contribute to developing new models to minimize the increased effort of this type of peer review while incentivizing reproducibility. Value: This study provides practical guidance toward designing the future of reproducibility-enabled in silico peer review, which is a logical extension of the computational reproducibility afforded by technical advances in dependency management, containerization, pipeline frameworks, and notebooks.

Now there's a single guidebook to help them meet that critical goal--straight from David Test, one of today's most highly respected authorities on transitions to adulthood. Packed with down-to-earth, immediately useful transition strategies, this book has the evidence-based guidance readers need to help students with moderate and severe disabilities prepare for every aspect of adult life, from applying for a job to improving social skills. Special educators, transition specialists, guidance counselors, and other professionals will discover how to: (1) align instruction with IDEA requirements; (2) pinpoint student needs and interests with formal and informal assessment strategies; (3) strengthen IEPs with measurable, relevant, and specific postsecondary goals; (4) teach students the skills needed to succeed; (5) use the most effective instructional strategies, such as mnemonics, response prompting, peer assistance, visual displays, and computer-assisted instruction; (6) assess effectiveness of instruction; (7) increase student and family involvement in transition planning--the best way to ensure positive outcomes that reflect a student's individual choices. Readers will help make transition as seamless as possible with practical materials that guide the planning process, including IEP templates and worksheets, checklists and key questions, thumbnails of key research studies, and sample scenarios that show teaching strategies in action. An essential road map for all professionals involved in transition planning, this book will help ensure that students with moderate and severe disabilities reach their destination: a successful adult life that reflects their goals and dreams. Contents of this book include: (1) Transition-Focused Education (David W. Test); (2) Transition Assessment for Instruction (Dawn A. Rowe, Larry Kortering, and David W. Test); (3) Teaching Strategies (Sharon M. Richter, April L. Mustian, and David W. Test); (4) Data Collection Strategies (Valerie L. Mazzotti and David W. Test); (5) Student-Focused Planning (Nicole Uphold and Melissa Hudson); (6) Student Development: Employment Skills (Allison Walker and Audrey Bartholomew); (7) Bound for Success: Teaching Life Skills (April L. Mustian and Sharon L. Richter); and (8) Strategies for Teaching Academic Skills (Allison Walker and Kelly Kelley).
