PCE employed a data collection system for monitoring and evaluation data that relied on engaging farmers and field agents of partner producer networks as active members of a data collection/feedback loop. Producer networks were trained to collect data and to use it to better plan and manage their own activities while also providing data for the project performance indicators. The producer networks used a set of data management tools established and validated through a close participatory process between the USAID/PCE technical team and partner networks across different value chains. Excel spreadsheets and GIS software were used to generate agricultural input (fertilizer, seeds) requirements and crop forecasts, track field activities, map farms, and organize harvests. The databases contain information on the producer members, partner producer organizations of the project, monitoring of agronomic activities of plots, financing, marketing, rainfall data, and results of output quality grading tests. The databases were audited by the PCE project's M&E staff and aggregated for the project's key performance indicators.",
