				"abstractNote": "This issues-based reference set on education in the United States tackles broad, contentious topics that have prompted debate and discussion within the education community. The volumes focus on pre-school through secondary education and explore prominent and perennially important debates. This set is an essential reference resource for undergraduate students within schools of education and related fields including educational administration, educational psychology, school psychology, human development, and more. Education of America's school children always has been and always will be a hot-button issue. From what should be taught to how to pay for education to how to keep kids safe in schools, impassioned debates emerge and mushroom, both within the scholarly community and among the general public. This volume in the point/counterpoint Debating Issues in American Education reference series tackles the topic of alternative schooling and school choice. Fifteen to twenty chapters explore such varied issues as charter schools, for-profit schools, faith-based schools, magnet schools, vouchers, and more. Each chapter opens with an introductory essay by the volume editor, followed by point/counterpoint articles written and signed by invited experts, and concludes with Further Readings and Resources, thus providing readers with views on multiple sides of alternative schooling and school choice issues and pointing them toward more in-depth resources for further exploration.",
