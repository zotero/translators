Malcolm Guite combines literary, theological, and ecological perspectives to shed new light on the ‘rich spirituality’ of Coleridge’s work, in the sacramental theology of his Rime of the Ancient Mariner (p. 8). Guite recounts Coleridge’s life story around a religious and ecological, ultimately polemical, reading of the Rime. Guite’s rationale for the biographical strand of his study is based on the poet’s retrospective self-identification with his protagonist. The book is divided into two sections. In Part One, Guite narrates Coleridge’s life up to the year of extraordinary creativity at Nether Stowey, which spanned summer 1797 to summer 1798. The seven chapters in Part Two...",

				"abstractNote": "There has been a recent increase in the popularity of humanist (individualized and mostly secular) marriage ceremonies in Poland. The propagators of humanist weddings consider these rites of passage as an alternative to both civil ceremonies, which are seen as “bland” and “template,” and also to their religious, especially Catholic, counterparts. The conducted research reveals the various motivations of people who decide on a humanist marriage ceremony. In addition to “nonreligious” or “antireligious” motivation, the analysis also pinpoints “anti-institutional,” “individualistic,” and “practical” motives. The paper analyzes these various motivations. It additionally addresses the issue of the individualization of humanist weddings and the limits of this process. By drawing upon Neil Gross’s distinction between regulative and meaning-constitutive traditions, I argue that while humanist ceremonies are a sign of the undermining of the regulative traditions and their power, couples still deploy meaning-constitutive traditions to anchor their ceremonies.",
