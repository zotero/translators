In this work, we introduce permuting/routing techniques to move plaintext elements across\nthese vectors efficiently. Hence, we are able to implement general arithmetic circuit in a batched fashion without ever needing to \"unpack\" the plaintext vectors.\n\nWe also introduce some other optimizations that can speed up homomorphic evaluation in certain cases. For example, we show how to use the Frobenius map to raise plaintext elements to powers of~$p$ at the \"cost\" of a linear operation.",

				"abstractNote": "Can we hope to provide provable security against model extraction attacks? As a step towards a theoretical study of this question, we unify and abstract a wide range of \"observational\" model extraction defenses (OMEDs) --- roughly, those that attempt to detect model extraction by analyzing the distribution over the adversary's queries. To accompany the abstract OMED, we define the notion of complete OMEDs --- when benign clients can freely interact with the model --- and sound OMEDs --- when adversarial clients are caught and prevented from reverse engineering the model. Our formalism facilitates a simple argument for obtaining provable security against model extraction by complete and sound OMEDs, using (average-case) hardness assumptions for PAC-learning, in a way that abstracts current techniques in the prior literature.\n\nThe main result of this work establishes a partial computational incompleteness theorem for the OMED: any efficient OMED for a machine learning model computable by a polynomial size decision tree that satisfies a basic form of completeness cannot satisfy soundness, unless the subexponential Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption does not hold. To prove the incompleteness theorem, we introduce a class of model extraction attacks called natural Covert Learning attacks based on a connection to the Covert Learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC '21), and show that such attacks circumvent any defense within our abstract mechanism in a black-box, nonadaptive way. As a further technical contribution, we extend the Covert Learning algorithm of Canetti and Karchmer to work over any \"concise\" product distribution (albeit for juntas of a logarithmic number of variables rather than polynomial size decision trees), by showing that the technique of learning with a distributional inverter of Binnendyk et al. (ALT '22) remains viable in the Covert Learning setting.",

Secondary constructions play a central role\nin constructing bent functions since a complete classification of this class\nof functions is elusive. This paper is devoted to establish a relationship\nbetween the secondary constructions and the composition of Boolean\nfunctions. We firstly prove that some well-known secondary constructions of\nbent functions, can be described by the composition of a plateaued Boolean\nfunction and some bent functions. Then their dual functions can be\ncalculated by the Lagrange interpolation formula. By following this\nobservation, two secondary constructions of\nbent functions are presented. We show that they are inequivalent to the known ones, and\nmay generate bent functions outside the primary classes $\\mathcal{M}$ and $%\n\\mathcal{PS}$. These results show that the method we present in this paper\nis genetic and unified and therefore can be applied to the constructions of Boolean\nfunctions with other cryptographical criteria.",

In the new drafts, the security of\nthe subsequent session credentials are based only on keys derived\nduring the unilateral authentication where the network server is\nauthenticated to the client. Client authentication is mentioned as an\noption in PEAP and EAP-TTLS, but is not mandated. Naturally, the PIC\nprotocol does not even offer this option, because the goal of PIC is\nto obtain credentials that can be used for client authentication.\n\nIn addition to running the authentication protocols within such tunnel\nit should also be possible to use them in legacy mode without any\ntunnelling so as to leverage the legacy advantages such as widespread\nuse. In this paper we show that in practical situations, such a mixed\nmode usage opens up the possibility to run a man-in-the-middle attack\nfor impersonating the legitimate client. For those well-designed\nclient authentication protocols that already have a sufficient level\nof security, the use of tunnelling in the proposed form is a step\nbackwards because they introduce a new vulnerability.\n\nThe problem is due to the fact that the legacy client authentication\nprotocol is not aware if it is run in protected or unprotected mode.\nWe propose to solve the discovered problem by using a cryptographic\nbinding between the client authentication protocol and the protection\nprotocol.",
