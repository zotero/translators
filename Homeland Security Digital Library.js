Studies performed in the early seventies indicated that nuclear power plants were not attractive targets for terrorism and that their construction was highly resistant to damage, yet there were conditions under which the radioactive containment features could be sabotaged. This conclusion prompted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in February 1977, to publish a revised section to the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10 Part 73.55. The new requirements were aimed specifically at countering any form of sabotage that could release radioactive material and thereby create a hazard for the general public. But implementation of the new law required reviewing and upgrading the security plans for more than 70 nuclear power plants each with unique nuclear and secondary systems and unique geographic and demographic environments. (There is no standard nuclear plant in the United States. Although a single manufacturer may provide the basic reactor system for a group of plants, the remainder of each plant is a composite provided by various contractors.)...Altogether the review process has had a profound effect upon the planning for security at nuclear power plants, especially in defining what we are trying to protect, what kinds of threats we face, and how we can realize the largest return for our investment in nuclear plant security. The review process also has implications for nuclear plant safety.",

Fueled by a religious fervor and united through Salafist dogma, ISIL overwhelmed Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) through use of tempo and deliberate lines of operation to achieve strategic aims. Within a two-month period, ISIL advanced hundreds of kilometers, secured multiple population clusters, and established a governmental regime to replace the Iraqi government. With the withdrawal of US combat power from Iraq, and the lucrative investment of Iraqi forces, multiple questions remain unanswered. How could a group of jihadists, with limited training, armed with technical vehicles and various small arms weapons overwhelm the security forces of the Iraqi government? [...] This monograph examines the presence of lines of operation, tempo, center of gravity, lines of effort, phasing and transitions during ISIL's offensive and consolidation activities. The monograph discusses ISIL's adherence to Salafist ideologies and the unique requirements to maintain a global caliphate. United by their interpretations of pure Sunni Islam, members of ISIL can converge both lethal and non-lethal action against belligerents. The monograph concludes with the understanding of ISIL's deliberate arrangement of lethal and non-lethal activity to accomplish strategic objectives.",
