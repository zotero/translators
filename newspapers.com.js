Mrs. Roosevelt BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Sunday Limited space prevented my telling you about several interest-lnc things which I did-in Youngstown, O., last jpnaay. loaay a sn&amp;u try to tell you a little more about this city, which seems to exist primarily for the production of steel. There is a certain majesty to this Industry which catches one's imagination. We came out from a street to find ourselves looking down over what seemed to be an almost limitless array of factory buildings and chimneys. The driver of our car said: \"That is the U. S. Steel Co. and it covers six miles. Think of. an investment renresented and of the stake which the people working here have in the success or failure of that business, not to mention the innumerable people who own a part of the invested capital. It takes your breath away Just to think that any human beings are responsible for anything so vast and far reaching. Visits Newspaper Indexing Project . , I saw two WPA projects during the morning. One. a visual education project in a school, was turning out extremely good material such a posters, pictures of birds, v samples of grass, trees, bugs, etc, for use in schools throughout the district. The other, an Ohio state project being carried on in several big cities, I have never happened to come across anywhere else, though .it is doubtless being done in many places. Newspapers in the various cities are being indexed and microfilms of the pages are being made. These films can be stored and lent with ease, and the Indexing material will make available information on ths news for the By Eleanor Roosevelt years which these projects cover. It takes several weeks to train a man for work on these projects which requires Intelligence and accuracy. I was interested to see that men and women of various ages and nationalities, including two colored men, were working on it. After lunch at one of the clubs in the city. I had an opportunity to talk with a number of WPA and NYA groups. In Industrial centers there is a pick-up in employment which is felt on both WPA and NYA projects, but this is not, the case as yet in small towns or rural areas. Beys Start Symphony Youngstown has a symphony orchestra which is entirely self-supporting and which was started by two young Italian boys. Many workers in the steel mill play in it, for among our American citizens of foreign nationalities we are more apt to find artistic ability one of their contributions for which we should be grateful. I visited a slum clearance project in the after noon which covers a large area and which they tell me replaces some long condemned buildings, which had been a blot on the city and a danger to the health of the people. I also had a glimpse of the park, which la one of the most .beautiful natural parKs I nave ever seen. We left Youngstown immediately after my lec- ture, spent a few hours in cohimous, u yesterday and found ourselves engulfed in a football crowd. We were tempted to stay over to see the Cornell-Ohio State game so as to be able to cheer our own state college. : . Now, after part of a day and another night on the train, we are in Birmingham, Ala. This country Is a big country when you start to criss-cross Itl",

Peter McManus's Saloon Robbed This Morning, One of the most daring burglaries and robberies that has been committed in this city for many years was perpetrated between the hours of one and three o'clock Thursday morning. in the very midst of the business centre, at a point rendered as bright day by surrounding electric lights, and on a street that is supposed to be constantly patroled at all times by vigilant policemen. Between the hours named the saloon and restaurant of Peter McManus, next door to Lohmann's on East Market street, was entered by burglars, and robbed of all its most valuable contents, Mr. McManus did not close his place until nearly midnight, and then going to the Exchange Hotel, chatted pleasantly on the porch with some friends before retiring. He securely locked and bolted the doors both front and rear, before leaving, and found them this morning in the same condition aS he had left them. What Was his surprise, however, on going behind his bar, to find the money drawer turned bottom upward on the floor, and further investigation showed that all of the most valuable goods in the store had been stolen, including about $300 worth of ten cent cigars, his entire supply of that grade, $150 worth of five cent cigars, 8 quantity of the best whisky, and everything that the robbers could conveniently carry. The drawer had been prled open with an ice pick which they had taken from the refrigerator, having previously broken both blades of a large pair of shears in the attempt. Mr. McManus does not know the exact amount of money he had left in the drawer, but thinks there were about seventeen dollars, mostly in silver. His entire loss will reach very close to $500, and Mr. McManus being by no means a rich man will no doubt feel it severely. The only possible way that the burglars could affect an entrance was through the transom over the front door, which had been left partly open. To reach this a ladder must have been brought into requisition, and the goods must have been handed out through the same aperture. How it was possible that all this could be accomplished without detection is one of mysterious features of the affair. Surely the policemen must have been elsewhere at that time. There is no positive clue to the burglars as yet. Though certain parties are suspected and are being shadowed, no evidence that would warrant an arrest has thus far been obtained. QUINN COMMITTED. He is Held in Default $700 Bail to Answer the Charge of Robbery. Thomas Quinn was arrested at Kingston last night for the robbery of Peter McManus's restaurant in this city, the particulars of which were given in Thursday's LEADER. Quinn has a record, and it is not altogether an enviable one. He has been in a number of scrapes. He was once arrested for threatening to kill his father, and then he was one of the fellows who robbed Bock &amp; Glover's jewelry store at Hazleton last winter. He turned state's evidence, it will be remembered and received a sentence to the county jail, while his companion in the crime, Shepherd, was sent to the penitentiary. When he left here for Philadelphia Shepherd said he would not be surprised to see Quinn at the penitentiary before he got out. He is very likely to see him there. Quinn had a hearing before the Mayor this morning and was committed to jail in default of $700 tail. When arraigned he pleaded not guilty, but the evidence seemed dead against him. McManus testified that he was in his place three times on the day before the robbery -the last time between 11 and 12 o'clock at night- and had stood him off for drinks. He also identified a 25 cent shinplaster, found in Quinn's possession when arrested, as one which had been in his money drawer for nine or ten months or possibly a year. A pair of scissors, which belonged to McManus, were found under the bar in his restaurant on the morning after the robbery, broken, and the piece that was broken off was found in Quinn's pocket after his arrest. The scissors had been used to pry open the money drawer. The finding of these things in Quinn's possession was evidence that he either committed the robbery himself or knew who did it, and he had no explanation to make as to how the articles came in his possession, When asked by the Mayor how long he had been out of jail he answered, \"'That's my business.\" He was quite impudent and denied having been in McManus's restaurant on Wednesday evening, as McManus said he was. He was released from jail, after serving his sentence for the Hazleton robbery, on June 30th.",

Plant Will Reopen; Police Ready # Trouble Is Expected at StrikeBound General Motors Factory Near Toronto, Canada. Oshawa, Ont., April 10 (AP) Canadian Press - Sixty men and women workers of the strikeclosed General Motors of Canada plant walked out without melestation through a picket line today and went back to work in the parts department. Thus : a situation which the CIO-Affiliated Automobile Workunion the company and government officials all had feared might break into open trouble passed peacefully - with no more incident that the prolonged jeers of the 160 pickets. The main plant, from which 3,700 union workers have struck, remained closed. The parts department was reopened for motor car and truck repair purposes and not for actual production. Oshawa, Ont., April 10 (Canad- ian Press) -Provincial authorities massed police reserves in nearby Toronto, ready for instant action, today as General Motors of Canada prepared to resume partial operation of its strike-bound Oshawa plant. Premier Mitchell Hepburn of Ontario Province, opponent of the committee for industrial organization in its Oshawa activity, declared government protection would be provided if necessary when the factory's parts department reopens. The extra police will not be sent, however, unless \"trouble develops and gets beyond the control of the municipality,\" he said. Representatives of the 3,700 strikers, called out by the United Automobile Workers of America, said any worker who wishes may enter the Oshawa plant but any worker who does \"is a strike breaker whether he thinks so or not.\" Hugh Thompson, CIO organizer, withdrew a statement he made at the same time saying the union \"will not be responsible for any accident that happens\" after such workers leave the plant, stating: \"I wish to retract the suggestion regarding the possibility â¢of accident to strikebreakers Force Is Used to Eject Group from State House at' Columbus, Ohio. SEVERAL INJURED BY THE OFFICERS Protesters Demanding Appropriation of $50,000,000 for the Needy. By GORDON C. NIXON Columbus, O., April 10 (AP)-A defiant group of 100 relief seekers occupied a church today as a haven from the office of Gov. Martin L. Davey from which they were dragged and carried by sheriff's deputies. Six of their organizers were in jail for investigation, cut off from all but attorneys. A committee of the Ohio Workers Alliance took over the leadership and declared they would stay in the state capital until their demands were met. Many nursed bruises made by officers' maces; nearly all went without food for nearly 12 hours from the time the National Guard stopped feeding them until they could take up a collection for supplies. \"The demonstration will continue,\" was the final declaration in a statement issued by temporary leaders. They declined to say if they would attempt to re-enter the governor's office which they held from late Wednesday until yesterday evening. Screaming, kicking and cursing, the marchers, mostly from the Toledo area, struggled for several minutes before ejection was completed. One was taken to a hospital for treatment. Another had severe bruises. Governor Davey, who had ordered them fed until yesterday noon, said, \"we tried to be very courteous to them, fed them, and tried to make them comfortable. of curse, there is a limit to all things.\" The climax of more than two months of Ohio relief crises still was ahead. The legislature appropriated in two installments a total of $6,- 000,000 for relief and flood aid from Jan. 1 to April 15 and deadlocked on proposals t make the counties contribute to a permanent relief program. Governor Davey urged matching of state funds. The house passed a bill providing $15,000,- 000 for a two-year relief porgram but turned down enabling acts (Turn to Page Three)",

A briek cannonading is being kept up. There is no information from the seaboard. The military are under arms. The whole population is on the streets, and the harbor is filled with anxious spectators. [SECOND DISPATCH.] The floating battery is doing good service. Up to eleven o clock there has been no loss on our side. Fort Sumter replied at 7 o'clock this morning, and has kept up an astonishing fire ever since. Stevens's battery is slightly injured. Three shells are fired per minute. Four hundred, in all, have fallen. A breach is expected to be made in Fort Sumter to-morrow. Major Anderson's fire is principally directed against the floating battery.

No casualty has yet happened to any of the forces. Only seven of the nineteen batteries have opened fire on Fort Sumter. The remainder are held ready for the expected fleet. Two thousand men reached the city this morning and immediately embarked for Morris Ieland. FOURTH DISPATCH. CHARLESTON, April 12, 11 P. M.- -The bombardment of Fort Sumter is going on every twenty minutes from the mortare. It is supposed Major Anderson is resting his men for the night. Three vessels of war are reported outside the bar. They cannot get in on account of the roughness of the 888. No one has as yet received any injary. The floating battery works admirably well.
